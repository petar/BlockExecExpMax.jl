# Level-2 block execution strategy example

This code computes an optimal level-2 block execution strategy,
aiming to maximize the expected proceeds. It assumes that
price uncertainty is modeled and given as a distribution over prices.

## Example

To compute an example strategy:

     ./run_example.sh
